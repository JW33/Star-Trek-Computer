# Star Trek Computer

Just a quick and simple program thrown together to see what it would take to make a quasi-AI for my computer.

Currently, the program detects and displays speech it recongizes if it is in the specified list.

Directions:

1. Plug in mic (and confirm it is working. The program will automcatically use it if it is the Default Device)
2. Run the program
3. Click the Start Listening button
4. Star Trek computer sound will go off and you will be able to give your command
5. Click the Stop Listening button
